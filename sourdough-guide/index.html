The quantities I give seem to work for the flour I&#39;m using. If you end up with big blobs try adding a bit less water the next time, even 10 or 20g less water can make a big difference.

Use a thermometer to measure it, before and make a note of it.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h3 id="autolyse">Autolyse</h3> <p>First of all we mix the flour and water on its own. Apparently this soaks the gluten in the flour in a way that can only be done when the mixture is just flour and water, adding salt seems to negatively effect this process.</p> <p>If you have a mixer, just shove all the flour and water together and use the mixer until its roughly together. I used to do this by hand but the mixture is quite sticky and getting it off your hands is a pain in the ass. If doing it by hand you just want things to be roughly mixed (i.e. all flour has got a bit wet) - no kneading at this stage, and you might want to keep a bit of water aside to make it easier to mix in other ingredients later.</p> <p>If you warmed your water, measure the temperature of the dough at this point and see how close you got to your target temperature, and next time you can adjust your water temperature if needed.</p> <p>You want to leave the flour and water alone for at least an hour, but if you don&#39;t think your starter has got fully to its peak yet you can leave it a bit longer (up to maybe around 3 hours?). I&#39;m not sure what happens if you leave it longer than this, I&#39;ve left mine for a few hours and it hasn&#39;t been a problem. Similarly if you think it has peaked early you can cut this short as needed.</p> <p>Just after mixing, pull your dough around a bit and see how stretchy it feels. After the hour is up, give it another tug - it&#39;ll hopefully feel different and a bit more glutenous which means hopefully it will hold its shape better later on when we bake it.</p> <p>Cover the dough to prevent bugs from landing on it and to prevent the surface from drying out (especially if your water was warmed) - you might want to spray the surface with a water spray too.</p> </div> <div class="sourdough-guide__time-taken"> <svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" class="icon"><path d="M256 8C119 8 8 119 8 256s111 248 248 248 248-111 248-248S393 8 256 8zm92.49 313l-20 25a16 16 0 01-22.49 2.5l-67-49.72a40 40 0 01-15-31.23V112a16 16 0 0116-16h32a16 16 0 0116 16v144l58 42.5a16 16 0 012.49 22.5z"/></svg> <div>Time taken: ~1 hour</div> </div> <div> <h3 id="add-leaven">Add leaven</h3> <p>Next we add the leaven on its own, we don&#39;t add the salt just yet. Apparently this is to let the yeast interact with gluten structure a bit (whatever that means) before the salt affects things. At first I thought maybe the salt would upset/damage the yeast if they were added together, but once mixed through the salt amount apparently isn&#39;t high enough to affect it the yeast so I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the reason. I have added the salt here before to save time and it wasn&#39;t a deal so don&#39;t worry about doing that to save a bit of time if you want.</p> <p>Mix the leaven completely through the flour. With my mixer I give the dough a good few minutes working here on a low setting to make sure everything is fully mixed, and this works the gluten a bit more.

In a bakery this would be a buttload of loaves, but here it&#39;s just our two loaves fermenting away together.</p> <p>I grab a small blob of dough at the start of this stage and put it in a small, see-through cup to use as a reference for how much the dough as expanded in size, as it can be quite hard to tell for the whole dough in a big bowl. I have a little measuring cup about the size of an egg cup which works quite well. Ideally you want something very small so that a doubling in size equals a decent change in height up the side of the cup. Try to pack your small blob of dough in so it has filled up the bottom fully (easier said than done) and use a rubber band to mark the start height.</p> <p>We also want to do some stretch-and-folds throughout this process to work a bit more structure into the dough, a bit more frequently at first then at longer intervals:</p> <ul> <li>wait 15/20 mins, do stretch and fold</li> <li>wait 15/20 mins, do stretch and fold</li> <li>wait 15/20 mins, do stretch and fold</li> <li>wait 30/45 mins, do stretch and fold</li> <li>wait 30/45 mins, do stretch and fold</li> <li>wait 30/45 mins, do stretch and fold</li> </ul> <p>If the temperature is warmer, I&#39;ll stick to the lower end of these timings, if it&#39;s cooler I&#39;ll go for the slightly longer gaps.</p> <p>This is kinda annoying as it keeps distracting you if you want to do soemthing else at the same time, but they are very quick to do (literally 30s).</p> <p>I wet my hands, then, grab one side of the dough (e.g. north) and stretch it vertically upwards as far as I can without breaking it, then fold it across to the opposite side (e.g. south). Then going round I do:</p> <ul> <li>east stretched to west folded over the top of previous fold</li> <li>south stretched to north folded over the top of previous fold</li> <li>west stretched to east folder over the top of the previous fold</li> </ul> <p>Then I kinda pick the dough up, and flip it so the folds are in the palms of my hands, give it a bit of a jiggle, and put it folded side down into the bowl.</p> <p>You should notice that the dough was initially very stretchy on the first fold, but by the time it&#39;s fully folded and you&#39;re flipping it, it is now very stubborn and un-stretchy. The way I do folds is fairly arbitrary, I think anything that gives the dough a stretch and folds it back together so that it becomes un-stretchy by the end will do the job here - you want to be creating separate layers in the gluten structure as part of this though.</p> <p>Sometimes I&#39;ll do a fold similar to what I&#39;ve seen other people call a &#39;coil fold&#39;, where I just pick the dough up right away by getting my hands under the middle of it - the sides free from from your hands will then probably stay stuck to the bottom. Drag the middle up while the sides are still stuck to get a good stretch on two sides at onces. Then kinda fold the stretched sides underneath, move your hands 90 degrees, and do it again. It should be a lot less stretchy the second time again.</p> <p>You wanna be fairly gentle throughout this stretch and fold process - try not to knock too much air out of the dough (there shouldn&#39;t be too much at the start which is why we do it a bit more frequently at the beginning, and then less frequently later on).</p> </div> <div class="sourdough-guide__time-taken"> <svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" class="icon"><path d="M256 8C119 8 8 119 8 256s111 248 248 248 248-111 248-248S393 8 256 8zm92.49 313l-20 25a16 16 0 01-22.49 2.5l-67-49.72a40 40 0 01-15-31.23V112a16 16 0 0116-16h32a16 16 0 0116 16v144l58 42.5a16 16 0 012.49 22.5z"/></svg> <div>Time taken: ~2-3 hours</div> </div> <div> <p>After doing all your folds, anywhere from 2-3 hours or so will have passed.</p> <p>Now just leave the dough alone for anohter hour or two, and keep an eye on your mini tester dough until you think it has roughly doubled.</p> </div> <div class="sourdough-guide__time-taken"> <svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" class="icon"><path d="M256 8C119 8 8 119 8 256s111 248 248 248 248-111 248-248S393 8 256 8zm92.49 313l-20 25a16 16 0 01-22.49 2.5l-67-49.72a40 40 0 01-15-31.23V112a16 16 0 0116-16h32a16 16 0 0116 16v144l58 42.5a16 16 0 012.49 22.5z"/></svg> <div>Time taken: ~1-2 hours</div> </div> <div> <h3 id="pre-shape">Pre-shape</h3> <p>Dump your dough out of the bowl onto your clean work-surface.
