                The steps I use to make sourdough, published here so I can
                complete my orbit around the Nerd Sun (and because someone asked
                for it).

                When reading various recipes online I found there was a of
                explanation as to _why_ certain steps are done, so I've tried to
                give my interpretations of the reasons for various steps as far
                as I understand them (which may or may not be accurate, ) from
                doing a fair bit of trial and error over the course of a year.
                There seems to be a lot of mysticism around some of the steps
                online and I can't find good explanations for what they are
                doing or if they are even necessary.

                The text for this guide lives
                [here](https://github.com/actionshrimp/actionshrimp.github.io/blob/master/src/sourdough-guide/index.html)
                if you feel like I've got something wildly inaccurate or I've
                missed a crucial detail and feel like correcting me.

                This assumes:
                - you're making the bread (usually every week) on Saturday, leave it in the fridge overnight and then bake it on Sunday morning.
                - you already have a fairly active starter.
                - your room temperature is somewhere in the low 20s (&#176;C). A
                temperature change of even a couple of degrees can have quite
                a big effect on timings (warmer speeds things up a lot!), so
                what worked for you in winter will probably need adjusting in
                summer. When you're starting out this seems like a big pain in the ass
                (_"I just wanna follow some instructions, damnit!"_) so I've
                tried to give ways to tell what stage things are at for a
                particular baking session where possible, although sometimes
                trial and error is the only way I'm afraid as your starter is
                unique and special (just like you).

                    - I tend to bake most weekends at the minute , and the rest of the time I keep my starter (Doughboy) in the fridge.
                    - You'll want to (approx.) the same amount of flour and water together [[2](#foot-2--flour-water-ratio)], but you can add more flour/water relative to the amount of starter if you want the starter to take longer to reach its peak (i.e. you don't always have to do a 1:1:1 ratio when feeding).
                    - Rye flour genuinely seems to make my starter a lot livelier compared to using just plain flour on its own.
                    - Have two identical jars (**A** and **B**), it makes life/cleanup a lot easier (mine are about 500ml [[1](#foot-1--jars)]).


                    ### Feeding the starter before putting it in the fridge for the week

                    Start with:

                    - 20g starter
                    - 40g flour (20g plain, 20g rye)
                    - 40g water

                    Shove it all in jar A, this should give the starter a decent amount
                    of food to get through. It will probably expand a bit and then drop
                    back down over the course of a few days.

                    If the starter seems inactive when you try and bake with it
                    (assuming it's usually active), or you're leaving it for longer than
                    a week, you might want to experiment with adding a bit more
                    flour/water (in equal parts) to appease the yeast.


                    ### Waking it up to bake

                    Friday evening at about 8pm, make the leaven [[3](#foot-3--leaven)].

                    I need 130g of starter to make two loaves which this covers, with a bit left over to go back in the fridge.

                    Start with:

                    - 15g starter from jar A
                    - 80g flour (40g plain, 40g rye)
                    - 80g water

                    Shove it all in jar B and leave it out overnight. Empty out jar A, put it in the dishwasher overnight (we'll need it tomorrow morning)!

                    The idea here is to give the starter plenty of food to eat overnight, so it is roughly approaching its peak the next morning and raring to go when we actually use it in our loaf (9 or 10am). As before you can experiment with the the amount of starter relative to flour. For example, reduce the starter quantity to e.g. 10g if you want this process to take longer so you can bake later in the day (as the amount of food available to each gram of starter will be greater).

                    ### Completing the cycle

                    Once you've used the ~130g of starter to bake with (see next section), mix your required amount of the remainder with flour and water back into the (now clean) jar A to put back into the fridge for next week and give jar B a clean.

                    ### Notes

                    <div id="foot-1--jars" md>**[1]** I have [these jars](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B078WYZZ4Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), although they aren't ideal (quite high/narrow which makes stirring in flour/water quite difficult) and I'd probably get some different ones if I hadn't bought these ones already! </div>
                    <div id="foot-2--flour-water-ratio" md>**[2]** if you're experimenting with different hydrations, I've read that trying to feed with the flour/water ratio for the hydratio youre aiming for can help 'train' your yeast for its baking conditions, but I don't particularly understand why this would help here / haven't tried it myself. Using 1:1 flour/water (or with even a tiny bit more water) makes it a lot easier to mix together with a spoon!</div>

                        I tried experimenting with different hydrations at the beginning as I got obsessed with the idea of high hydration being somehow fancier and imagining moist, fluffy, cloud-like loaves. I just ended up with loaves that were big blobs as my dough lacked the strength to hold all the water - reducing the hydration a bit seemed to fix things, allowing my loaves to keep the right shape (while still tasting great!).

                        I'm fairly convinced the hydration you can get away with is mostly guided by the flour you use [[1](#foot-1--hydration)]. The quantities I give seem to work for the flour I'm using. If you end up with big blobs try adding a bit less water the next time, even 10 or 20g less water can make a big difference. If your dough is seems too stiff, try adding a bit more water - if you use more wholemeal flour (relative to white flour) then you might need more water.

                            Adjust the total flour if you want bigger/smaller loaves (or if you're low on flour).

                            #### Water temperature

                            A note on water temperature - you can microwave your
                            water a bit if your room is cold to speed things up
                            a bit. As it will get mixed with colder flour,
                            you'll need to get it a few degrees warmer than your
                            ideal temperature (which is around 26&#176;C for the
                            yeast - you might want things slightly warmer than
                            this if your room is cold as it will cool down
                            during the fermentation process), try aiming for 29
                            or 30&#176;C. Use a thermometer to measure it,
                            before and make a note of it.
                        </div>

                    </div>

                    <div md>
                        ### Autolyse

                        First of all we mix the flour and water on its own.
                        Apparently this soaks the gluten in the flour in a way
                        that can only be done when the mixture is just flour and
                        water, adding salt seems to negatively effect this
                        process.

                        If you have a mixer, just shove all the flour and water
                        together and use the mixer until its roughly together. I
                        used to do this by hand but the mixture is quite sticky
                        and getting it off your hands is a pain in the ass. If
                        doing it by hand you just want things to be roughly
                        mixed (i.e. all flour has got a bit wet) - no kneading
                        at this stage, and you might want to keep a bit of water
                        aside to make it easier to mix in other ingredients
                        later.

                        If you warmed your water, measure the temperature of the
                        dough at this point and see how close you got to your
                        target temperature, and next time you can adjust your
                        water temperature if needed.

                        You want to leave the flour and water alone for at least
                        an hour, but if you don't think your starter has got
                        fully to its peak yet you can leave it a bit longer (up
                        to maybe around 3 hours?). I'm not sure what happens if
                        you leave it longer than this, I've left mine for a few
                        hours and it hasn't been a problem. Similarly if you
                        think it has peaked early you can cut this short as
                        needed.

                        Just after mixing, pull your dough around a bit and see
                        how stretchy it feels. After the hour is up, give it
                        another tug - it'll hopefully feel different and a bit
                        more glutenous which means hopefully it will hold its
                        shape better later on when we bake it.

                        Cover the dough to prevent bugs from landing on it and
                        to prevent the surface from drying out (especially if
                        your water was warmed) - you might want to spray the
                        surface with a water spray too.

                        ### Add leaven

                        Next we add the leaven on its own, we don't add the salt
                        just yet. Apparently this is to let the yeast interact
                        with gluten structure a bit (whatever that means) before
                        the salt affects things. At first I thought maybe the
                        salt would upset/damage the yeast if they were added
                        together, but once mixed through the salt amount
                        apparently isn't high enough to affect it the yeast so I
                        don't think that's the reason. I have added the salt
                        here before to save time and it wasn't a deal so don't
                        worry about doing that to save a bit of time if you
                        want.

                        Mix the leaven completely through the flour. With my
                        mixer I give the dough a good few minutes working here
                        on a low setting to make sure everything is fully mixed,
                        and this works the gluten a bit more. If doing things by
                        hand, work it to a fully mixed state.

                        Wait 30 mins.

                    </div>

                    <div md>
                        ### Add salt

                        Just before adding the salt, give the dough another mix
                        (a minute or two on the mixer, few mins by hand) for its
                        final taste of saltless freedom.

                        Then chuck in the salt and mix some more - again a
                        minute or two on the mixer, few mins by hand). If you
                        leave the mixer running while you add the salt, you
                        might notice the way it mixes look a bit different as
                        its added (this is kinda tricky to describe).

                        I mark this as the start of my bulk fermentation stage,
                        so I start a stopwatch at this point to keep an eye on
                        how long things have taken.

                        Again cover your dough (and give it a light spray).

                        ### Bulk fermentation

                        This stage is called bulk fermentation as you're
                        fermenting all the loaves your making together 'in
                        bulk'. In a bakery this would be a buttload of loaves,
                        but here it's just our two loaves fermenting away together.

                        I grab a small blob of dough at the start of this
                        stage and put it in a small, see-through cup to
                        use as a reference for how much the dough as expanded in
                        size, as it can be quite hard to tell for the whole
                        dough in a big bowl. I have a little measuring cup about
                        the size of an egg cup which works quite well. Ideally
                        you want something very small so that a doubling in size
                        equals a decent change in height up the side of the cup.
                        Try to pack your small blob of dough in so it has filled
                        up the bottom fully (easier said than done) and use a
                        rubber band to mark the start height.

                        We also want to do some stretch-and-folds throughout
                        this process to work a bit more structure into the
                        dough, a bit more frequently at first then at longer
                        intervals:

                        - wait 15/20 mins, do stretch and fold
                        - wait 15/20 mins, do stretch and fold
                        - wait 15/20 mins, do stretch and fold
                        - wait 30/45 mins, do stretch and fold
                        - wait 30/45 mins, do stretch and fold
                        - wait 30/45 mins, do stretch and fold

                        If the temperature is warmer, I'll stick to the lower end of these timings, if it's cooler I'll go for the slightly longer gaps.

                        This is kinda annoying as it keeps distracting you if you want to do soemthing else at the same time, but they are very quick to do (literally 30s).

                        I wet my hands, then, grab one side of the dough (e.g. north) and stretch it vertically upwards as far as I can without breaking it, then fold it across to the opposite side (e.g. south). Then going round I do:

                        - east stretched to west folded over the top of previous fold
                        - south stretched to north folded over the top of previous fold
                        - west stretched to east folder over the top of the previous fold

                        Then I kinda pick the dough up, and flip it so the folds
                        are in the palms of my hands, give it a bit of a jiggle,
                        and put it folded side down into the bowl.

                        You should notice that the dough was initially very
                        stretchy on the first fold, but by the time it's fully
                        folded and you're flipping it, it is now very stubborn
                        and un-stretchy. The way I do folds is fairly arbitrary,
                        I think anything that gives the dough a stretch and
                        folds it back together so that it becomes un-stretchy by
                        the end will do the job here - you want to be creating
                        separate layers in the gluten structure as part of this
                        though.

                        Sometimes I'll do a fold similar to what I've seen other
                        people call a 'coil fold', where I just pick the
                        dough up right away by getting my hands under the middle
                        of it - the sides free from from your hands will then
                        probably stay stuck to the bottom. Drag the middle up
                        while the sides are still stuck to get a good stretch on
                        two sides at onces. Then kinda fold the stretched sides
                        underneath, move your hands 90 degrees, and do it again.
                        It should be a lot less stretchy the second time again.

                        You wanna be fairly gentle throughout this stretch and
                        fold process - try not to knock too much air out of the
                        dough (there shouldn't be too much at the start which is
                        why we do it a bit more frequently at the beginning, and
                        then less frequently later on).

                        After doing all your folds, anywhere from 2-3 hours or
                        so will have passed.

                        Now just leave the dough alone for
                        anohter hour or two, and keep an eye on your mini tester
                        dough until you think it has roughly doubled.

                        ### Pre-shape

                        Dump your dough out of the bowl onto your clean work-surface. Use a silicon spoon/scraper to help ease it out so it doesnt stretch too much and squeeze air out.

                        Wet your bench scraper (to stop it sticking to the dough), and chop the dough into two halves.

                        On each half at a time, first scrape around the dough piece to get it into a roughly round shape. Then scrape the dough along the surface - the opposite side should stick to the surface and create tension on the dough ball. Do this a few times in various directions until the dough has formed into a nice ball - you'll get the idea of this and get better at this with practice. Try not to mess with the dough too much as air will escape and you might end up over-working it which can actually cause you to lose some of the tension you've built up. With practice and good dough consistency you should be able to get a good ball in just a few scrapes.

                        Repeat on the other dough, and if you have your little tester ball you can do the same to that too to make a little doughball snack.

                        Leave for 25 mins.
