This is the source for actionshrimp.com. I got sick of forgetting how the blog system I was using before worked every time I wanted to actually post anything, so I've tried to keep things as simple as possible, although I'm sure this will inevitably be broken in some way in another 5 years :D

## dev

    make deps
    make pages-dev

Then navigate to http://localhost:1234/index.html. *Note*: you need `/index.html`.
